\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{\large Lesson 4: List weakest area, ``\emph{Practice makes perfect}''}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item I am not very good at math especially for a computer science student.
    This is probably only weakest area I never try to improve, but definitely I
    will try to improve by studying on my own during summer vacation.
    \item Another area I think I definitely need practice soon is interview question
    and solving/coding those questions on the spot. I will use outside resources, like
    leetcode and ask friends in the industry for help.
  \end{enumerate}
