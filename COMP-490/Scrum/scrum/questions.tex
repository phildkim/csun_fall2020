\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{\large Lesson 7:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item From what you submitted for project 1, would you pursue and make it a full product? How and why?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Yes, I think I would because it's something I could of used for this semester and probably will need it for the following. 
      \item How, by working really hard and trying to recruit some fellow students that is as hard working as I am and then maybe with 
      a prototype, we can get some funding to get it into production.
      \item Why, I feel like it's a useful application that all students can use.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{\large Lesson 8:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What was your first research spike and explain how you approached it?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Official research spike would be MomentAR the application itself and then the users of this application.
      \item I watched your demo of how the application is suppose to be used and discussed with my team regarding how
      the app can detect the users emotion. It was not easy since none of us have any experience with children in need
      of special care. There is a lot of psychology in this app and this is a new field we all need to research carefully.
