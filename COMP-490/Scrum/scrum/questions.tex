    numerous times that he/she has been doing all the work and you aren't
    doing anything. How would you reply?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item That would never happen to me, but hypothetically speaking I would apologize 
      to my fellow employee and boss. I wouldn't tell them any excuses, just be honest 
      and try to contribute any way possible.
