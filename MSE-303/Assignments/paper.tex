Lawrence Summers (born November 30, 1954), former preseident, where he is currently a professor and director at 
Harvard University had quite a contraversial matter regarding women being underrepresented in science and engineering.
Summers defended his statement on why women have lesser capability to accel in certain fields like science and engineering.
He stated three main points each respectively ordered; high-powered job hypothesis, availability of aptitude, and socialization of
discrimination.\cite{lawrencesummers}

\par
In describing what exactly is a high-powered job, are jobs that require higher amount of working hours whether you're
in the office or not. Certain jobs require leadership roles such as Chief Executive Offices at major corporations.
Typeically, these are jobs predomiantly by men and not women because women \say{choose} to be pregenat.

\par
His second hypothesis, probably caused the most controversy, stated the availability of aptitude.

\par
Lastly, socialization and pattern of discrimination.

\par
My viewpoints on this matter

\par
In conclusion, it was in Summers best interest to resign as Harvard's Preseident.
