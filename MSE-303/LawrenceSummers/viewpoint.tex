Providing my point of view, as a computer science student without
a doubt, women are most definitely minorities and underrespresented
just as Summers pointed out. However, I would completely disagree on
the reasoning for the lack of female genders. First, I would like to
point out, women were to ones to invent the first computer program, 
so if anyone were to say women don't belong in computer science or any 
science is making themselves look very ignorant.
\say{Ada Lovelace is often regarded as the first female computer programmer,~\cite{firstprogrammer}}.

Inversly, I believely socialization and patterns of discrimination
has most attribute affect on why women are underrespresented. And
for high-powered job hypothesis could be true but there isn't enough
data or evidence to actually prove Summers to be correct. Then as for
availability of aptitude, just as most people were outraged by his 
claims, I too, baffled by his egocentric ways.
