# TO-DO-LIST

## PHIL 365

- [ ] _**Due August 30**_ : Discussion: Getting to know each other

1. When you were a kid, what did you want to do when you grew up? How does that relate to your current aspirations for your life after your graduate from CSUN?
I've changed my goals and aspirations so many times, it's embrassing to list out all of them, but at some point in my early teens when I was presuing to become a professional gamer, I knew that I wanted to be infront of a computer making a living. Although I did enjoy playing games, I eventually realized I needed to presue an actual career, no offense to any gamers but it's a young boy/man career.

2. What do you most miss doing that you haven't been able to do during the coronavirus pandemic?
I miss studying at the library and birthday dinners with friends.

3. Looking through the syllabus, what topic looks the most interesting to you? Why? Universal Basic Income (UBI). I would like your insight on this topic and I think it's a important topic with coronavirus pandemic affecting not only Americans but world-wide in need of government assistence. Also, Andrew Wang had some valid points on new industrial revolution of automation. A lot of jobs are going to be taken over by computers/robots and majority of Americans without jobs. I have concerns for another great depression. Is UBI the solution?
